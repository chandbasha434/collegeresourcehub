The document describes a College Resource Hub, which is a web-based platform for students.
The main idea: a centralized place where students can upload, share, and access study resources like notes, past exam papers, and study guides.

🎯 Core Objectives

The project has 4 main goals:

Structured Repository

Create a properly organized library of resources.

Easy to navigate and contribute.

Advanced Categorization

Use tagging & categorization by subject and semester.

Help students find what they need quickly.

Quality Assessment

Students can rate resources.

High-quality and useful materials will appear at the top.

Collaborative Learning

Encourage peer-to-peer sharing.

Build a community-driven knowledge base.

🌟 Key Features & Functionalities

Secure Authentication

Login system with roles (students, admins).

JWT-based authentication for security.

Resource Management

Upload/download study notes, past papers, and guides.

File validation to ensure correct formats.

Rating & Feedback System

Students can give ratings and reviews.

Helps improve the quality of uploaded materials.

Smart Dashboard

Shows top-rated resources, most downloaded ones.

Gives personalized recommendations based on user activity.

🛠️ Recommended Technology Stack
